# sACN

*Streaming ACN (sACN)* is an ANSI standard for entertainment technology by
[ESTA](http://tsp.esta.org) for transmission of DMX512 data over IP networks. sACN is widely used
in the entertainment industry for real-time control of entertainment technology, especially
lighting fixtures.

This repository contains a C-language library and a C++ wrapper library for communicating via sACN.

## Building

For instructions on building the sACN library, as well as an sACN overview and in-depth
documentation, please see the [documentation](https://etclabs.github.io/sACNDocs).

## Standard Version

This library implements ANSI E1.31-2018. You can download the standard document for free from the
[ESTA TSP downloads page](https://tsp.esta.org/tsp/documents/published_docs.php).
